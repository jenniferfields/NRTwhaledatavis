**Abstract**
Whales serve important biological and cultural functions in the California Current ecosystem (CCE). Due to recent concerns regarding anthropogenic impacts on whales, the California Ocean Protection Council recently articulated a goal to achieve zero mortality for CCE whales, with a target of creating a statewide plan by 2022. Achieving zero mortality is a laudable but difficult goal to achieve as success depends on understanding the existing sources of mortality, the opportunities for policy change, and coordination of activities across the entire CCE. This review synthesizes the available research on drivers of mortality for nine whale species in the CCE and existing policy that addresses those drivers. Five main threats contribute to whale mortality in the CCE and are currently targeted through relevant policy responses: entanglement, vessel strikes, noise, water quality, and marine debris. Three threats remain largely unaddressed in management, despite their contribution to lethal and sublethal impacts on whales: nutritional stress, disease, and predation. Ultimately, sources of whale mortality are interconnected and their impacts span both geographic and jurisdictional boundaries, necessitating a holistic approach to managing whale mortality in the CCE.

**Data**

This project used a total of four data sets for this project using 2010-2019 data including: Entangled Whale dataset for Washington, Oregon, and California from 1982-2019, Strandings dataset for California 1982-2005, Strandings dataset for California 2006-2019, and Strandings dataset for Washington and Oregon 1974-2019
